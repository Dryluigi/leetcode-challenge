# Stones and Jewels

## Information

- LeetCode URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer
- Level: **Easy**

## Analysis

How my algorithm solve the problem,

| Metrics | Value | Description |
| --- |:---:|----|
| Time Complexity | O(n) | No inner loop involved, only two loops are used. The first loop finds Linked List length. Second loop iterates over the linked list length. |
| Space Complexity | O(1) | No dynamic data structure involved. Only pointer to iterate the Linked List |

## Result

Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100%** of Go online submissions for Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer.

Memory Usage: **2 MB**, less than **74.79%** of Go online submissions for Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer.
